Social media has forever changed the way consumers talk about products, services, and brands. Now, all a customer needs to do to share good or bad product experience with 10 to 10,000+ of their “friends” is hit the “post” button on a social media account. 

While the power of social media is worrying to many companies, it’s not nearly as worrying as this simple fact — *most consumers trust the product recommendations and reviews they receive from friends and/or other customers*. 

According to the [Nielsen Global Survey of Trust in Advertising](http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/reports/2013/global-trust-in-advertising-and-brand-messages.html) (2013), 84% of consumers trust word of mouth recommendations from friends while 68% trust the the product and/or service opinions they see posted online by other consumers. 

Fortunately, there is a way for companies to evaluate online consumer conversations surrounding their products, services, and brands — through social listening. 

###What Is Social Listening? 

Social listening is a digital engagement method that enables companies to “listen in” on customer conversations and feedback about their products and services on social media channels and online forums. 

With social listening, companies can track online conversations based on specific keywords and phrases related to their products, services, and brand(s) — enabling them to get direct consumer feedback/insight.
